## **This site is not yet mobile compatible**

I created this site to highlight my daughters 'A-Level' art and testiles portfolios. There was a requirement for her to compile her work into a portfolio to present to universities so I took the opportunity to practice my web development skills.
The site is split into the four main themes of Rhiannon's portfolio:
- Skulls & Portraiture
- The Built Environment
- Everyday Items
- Art Textiles
