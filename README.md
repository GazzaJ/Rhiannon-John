## **This site is not yet mobile compatible**
The reason I didn't initially focus on a mobile first design is that I don't believe viewing the images on a mobile device would be ideal, as the images would be too small.
I will eventually make this a responsive website.

I created this site to highlight my daughters 'A-Level' art and testiles portfolios. There was a requirement for her to compile her work into a portfolio to present to universities so I took the opportunity to practice my web development skills.
The site is split into the four main themes of Rhiannon's portfolio:
- Skulls & Portraiture
- The Built Environment
- Everyday Items
- Art Textiles

## **Technologies Used**
This initial version of the site is relatively straightforward using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I chose to use this project to continue practicing my Tailwind CSS skills, and have enjoyed the usability of the Tailwind utility classes, and how simple and quick they are to start using.
